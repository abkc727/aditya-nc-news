The developer must create .env.development and .env.dev files to the project's main folder. the files must contain the environment variable PGDATABASE in the format - PGDATABASE=<db_name> with the curresponding database names. eg: for test data, if db name is db_test, a .env.dev file should be created containing PGDATABASE=db_test.
